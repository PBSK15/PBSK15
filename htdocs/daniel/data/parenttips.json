		["Children like to be reminded of their favorite characters through pictures. With these coloring pages, children can add their own creative ideas with crayons and markers. And the pictures they make can even be a gift for someone they care about."
		],
	"FishtankGame":
		["How good it is for children to see that fish, like people, are so much alike, yet each one is unique. Just watching as the fish move in different ways can help young children focus attention, which is an important part of learning."
		],
	"TeaPartyGame":
		["Playing tea party is a way for children to work on important social skills, like thinking about the needs of others and taking turns. They also learn about getting along with friends, as children imitate grownup behavior with manners and caring conversation."
		],
	"MakeBelieveGame":
		["For some children imaginative play comes easily. Others need encouragement. In this game, when children make choices for Daniel’s make-believe play, they can find encouragement for their own imaginative ideas and build their real-life skills of creative thinking, visualizing and problem-solving."
		],
	"BathroomGame":
		["Little by little children learn to take care of themselves, like brushing their teeth, washing their hands and going to the potty. With this game you and your child have a way to play about and practice some bathroom routines."
		],
	"BedtimeGame":
		["Each family has its own bedtime routines to help children with the transition from day to night. Bedtime can be hard because it separates children from the ones they love. This game can help you and your children play about and talk about things that help at bedtime."
		],
	"CreativityGame":
		["Making something for someone is one way to say \"I love you.\" This game gives children a way to create a card for someone they care about - and helps them know that everyone in the world, young and old, is a giver and a receiver."
		],
	"TrolleyGame":
		["What fun it is for children to be in charge of things that go - like Trolley. When children play this game, they have a chance to work on some of their feelings when people they love go away and come back."
		],
	"MusicGame":
		["Music is one way we all have to express our feelings. Using both the keyboard and the mouse, you and your child can play this game together to create music that shows different feelings - happy, sad and mad. Your child might even want to dance to the music, too."
		],
	"DoctorGame":
		["This game gives you and your child a way to play together with the instruments that doctors use. When children play about being the doctor, they're in charge. That makes it easier to manage when they have to be the patient."
		],
	"SandcastleGame":
		["Children’s creativity thrives in open-ended play, like building sandcastles.  Just like playing at the beach or in a sandbox, there is no right or wrong way to play this game. And if a wave erases their creation, children can easily start over again, 'bouncing back' from disappointment."
		],
	"DressUpGame":
		["Whether children dress up as people who are most familiar to them – like their moms and dads or community helpers like doctors and firemen – or in silly or fancy costumes, dress-up play encourages children to pretend and imagine. And dressing up builds social skills as children think about what other people do or feel."
		],
	"BabyBathGame":
		["One of the best ways to help older children adjust to a new baby is to encourage them to be helpers. That gives them a way to feel proud of being the older one, with their own special and important  place in the family – even if the baby seems to get lots of attention."
