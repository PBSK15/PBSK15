Directory 58 and before are totally unmodified assets from the original Creaturepedia. Anything assets in a directory after 58 are grabbed from the new Creaturepedia. As a result, it may not totally mirror the assets of the original for the newly added creatures (although most of the time they do). Each asset corresponds to its correct directory; anything in "unknown" are added manually due to the fact that there being no archives of the original Creaturepedia responses containing those respective creatures, and as such whatever directory those assets belonged to is unknown.

----------------------------
These are asset choices selected by ME for specific creatures that don't make much sense. If you remember what it was like in the original, then please notify me (by opening an issue). Here is a list:

* Thumbnail for cheetah danger alert

Missing creatures
---------------------
The new Creaturepedia is not actually FULLY identical to the original. If it weren't as similar in terms of assets utilized, it wouldn't have been that big of a deal, however there is a list of removed creatures. Here is a list:
* Monarch butterfly (57)
