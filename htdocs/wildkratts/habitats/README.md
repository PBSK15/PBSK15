The HabitatLoader.original.swf file is the original HabitatLoader.swf file as retrieved from the Wayback Machine. The file named "HabitatLoader.swf" is a modified version of this file, which contains the recreated version (not 1:1, as the foreground layer is different, but there is no real way of retrieving the original asset nor recreating it to any notably meaningful degree) of the Tortuga Sonoran Desert landing transition (based on this video: https://youtu.be/2UJ2pdO2lGA?t=9). The Central American Rainforest landing transition was *not* recreated, as no footage exists of the habitat, nonetheless the transition. 

Each habitat has an accompanying `.original.swf` file (which is the file as retrieved by the Wayback Machine) and may have an accompanying `.r53.swf` file (which is the file as retrieved from r53-vip-soup.pbskids.org). Each habitat has been modified to possess the following characteristics:

* Snake and Dolphin discs (Added in from 2013 onwards)
* Splash sound effect when you jump in a body of water (Added in from 2014 onwards)
* Creaturepedia integration (modification only necessary for the Ocean Habitat, whose integration didn't function, 2013 onwards)
* Have the CPS bar be disabled (discs be unselectable without earning them first) by default (only necessary for the Sonoran Desert and Central American Rainforest habitats)
* Skip the parts where Chris/Martin inform the user to press Space to jump and change your character via going to Your Room. This was added after the 2014 site overhaul.

Additionally, the 2013 versions (Wayback Machine versions) are used as the bases for the modified habitats since they have Creaturepedia integration.
