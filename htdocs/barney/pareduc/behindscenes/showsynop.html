            Barney's friends are racing to clean up the park, but Kami has trouble 
            keeping up with the other kids - even when they pretend to be ants 
            marching in a parade! Barney and Scott visit the Idea Bench where 
            Scott comes up with a great idea - to show Kami that even though the 
            caboose is the last car in the train, it's the most important because 
            that's where the conductor rides. With Kami playing &quot;Conductor 
            for the Day,&quot; they learn all about trains and have fun checking 
            out a model train. Then, they work together to clean up the old caboose 
            in the park as they sing &quot;I've Been Working On the Railroad.&quot; 
            When Barney tells them how railroad signal flags are used, the children 
            make their own flags and wave them around the park. Barney's friends 
            learn that from the first to the last in line, everyone is special.

            Tony wants to show off his handmade kite - but it doesn't have a string, 
            so the kite isn't ready to fly. When an unexpected breeze blows it 
            high in the treetops, Barney and the kids discuss the ups and downs 
            of getting the kite out of the tree. The kids discover more about 
            what's up and what's down in the world all around them as they sing 
            &quot;Up Is Up and Down Is Down.&quot; Playing fun games like London 
            Bridge and I Spy also helps the kids discover more about up, down 
            and all around. Finally, with a great idea from Tony and a little 
            inspiration from Baby Bop, the &quot;The Baby Bop Hop&quot; brings 
            the kite tumbling down from the treetop. Every day can have its ups 
            and downs, but thanks to Barney and his friends, every day can be 
            all around fun for everyone! <br>

            Tea time is the perfect time to practice good manners. Gianna invites 
            two special guests - Baby Bop and BJ! When they find the decorations 
            they need in the caboose, the flowers make Baby Bop sneeze, and they 
            all sing &quot;Keep Your Sneeze To Yourself&quot; so Baby Bop can 
            learn the right way to sneeze. After the friends dress up like high 
            society, it's time for tea. Baby Bop learns that the magic words &quot;Please&quot; 
            and &quot;Thank You&quot; are the correct words to use when asking 
            for more cookies. And singing &quot;Clean Up! Do Our Share&quot; makes 
            cleaning up good manners and good, clean fun. Barney puts on a humorous 
            presentation about bad manners with a story about some messy kids 
            named &quot;The Floodledoops.&quot; The silliness continues as they 
            sing &quot;Silly Sounds.&quot; Reminding his friends about good manners 
            while having fun is definitely proper etiquette for their purple pal.

            Barney's having a &quot;dog gone&quot; good time. Bingo needs to go 
            to the veterinarian, but he's hiding in the tool shed. The kids help 
            Mr. Boyd search for Bingo, singing, &quot;Where, Oh Where Has My Little 
            Dog Gone?&quot; Barney invites the TV audience to join in the search 
            for Bingo. When BJ hears Bingo is going to the vet, he and the kids 
            pretend they're going to the doctor too. Then BJ is back to his search 
            for buried treasure - his missing baseball, which he suspects was 
            buried by Bingo. Ms. Duffy introduces the kids to her guide dog, Kellie, 
            and teaches them more about guide dogs. While getting ready for his 
            baseball game, BJ has an unusual audience - Mr. Steele and his four 
            Chihuahuas. Young children will enjoy playing like man's best friend 
            as they sing &quot;Leg Over Leg&quot; and explore a variety of dogs 
            on Barney's computer. They'll learn that taking care of pets is a 
            nice way to show you love them! <br>

            When the Enjoy-Your-Toys Company delivers a bunch of boxes, Barney's 
            friends are excited. Expecting new toys, they're surprised to find 
            empty boxes. With a little encouragement from Barney and a lot of 
            imagination, Scott turns a shoebox into a turtle, and Kami finds the 
            time to turn a box into a grandfather clock. Whitney and Mario set 
            sail in their cardboard ship, and Scott and Kami go for a drive in 
            their &quot;box cars.&quot; When Kami and Mario build a cardboard 
            castle, the stage is set for fairy tale time with Barney. Then, a 
            packing box becomes home to a pachyderm as the kids join BJ for circus 
            fun. Finally, Barney's marching band makes beautiful music from a 
            bunch of boxes. Children will use their imaginations as they are engaged 
            in crafts, games and fantasy play, and they'll love singing fun songs 
            like &quot;The Elephant Song&quot; and &quot;Little Turtle.&quot;

            While Angela enjoys playing traffic cop in the park with her STOP 
            and GO signs, Baby Bop gets a quick lesson in opposites - up/down, 
            stop/go, in/out, and high/low. When Officer Phillips visits the park, 
            Baby Bop signals her when to stop and go. Next, Bingo is the perfect 
            playmate for Baby Bop's <i>Stop &amp; Go</i> game. Barney and the 
            kids enjoy a day of non-stop fun with a costume parade, a game of 
            musical <i>Stop &amp; Go</i>, and a display of some very vigorous 
            body movements as they sing &quot;Move Your Body.&quot; The fun doesn't 
            stop when they slow their bodies down. Barney reads a playful version 
            of &quot;The Three Billy Goats&quot; as the kids act out a fantasy 
            version on the bridge. Finally, it's time to stop the activity and

            Sarah leaves a colorful trail of footprints to guide Mario to their 
            Caboose Color Collection. Strangely enough, Mario's flying pig fits 
            into the red collection perfectly as the kids sing the fun song, &quot;The 
            Flying Pig.&quot; But how does a haystack fit into the blue collection? 
            And where will they find more yellow objects for the yellow collection? 
            Miss Jo paints a yellow flower, and Sarah makes yellow flowers out 
            of crepe paper. Baby Bop contributes her yellow blankey, which leads 
            to a search for a substitute blankey - but red and blue blankeys are 
            just not the same as her <br>
            favorite yellow one. When Barney makes the yellow flowers magically 
            grow, Baby Bop is delighted to get her yellow blankey back. The day 
            is a celebration of primary colors but, like all days with Barney,

            are exercising while they play. Soon more children join them for a

            indoors as well. Barney invites the TV viewers to run in place with 
            him and reminds everyone of the importance of stretching. When BJ's

            Everyone is excited about the evening concert with Mr. Boyd's brass 
            band. Angela is learning to play the trumpet but needs a lot of practice 
            before she can join the band, and BJ hopes to drum up a gig with the 
            band. In the meantime, the kids view Mr. Boyd's collection of horns 
            on display in the caboose. As they learn about French horns, trumpets, 
            trombones and tubas, Barney admits that he has tooted a tuba tune 
            a time or two in his time and breaks into a fun tuba instrumental. 
            When the kids offer to help Mr. Boyd decorate, they find themselves 
            searching for missing band posters - which leads to nursery rhyme 
            fun with &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot; and &quot;Old King Cole.&quot; 
            As the band practices, Barney - the Grand Poobah of the tuba - and

            &quot;Over In the Meadow.&quot; Baby Bop discovers a leaf with a caterpillar 
            in a cocoon and decides to keep it in Terry's old box. She searches 
            the caboose for things to put in the box to make the caterpillar more 
            comfy but can't find anything until Barney suggests her yellow blankey 
            to keep the caterpillar nice and warm. She discovers more &quot;ins&quot; 
            and &quot;outs,&quot; including some Russian nesting dolls. Finally, 
            Baby Bop watches her little butterfly fly away. Whether in or out, 
            every day is special with Barney! <br>

            Spring showers bring more than flowers; they bring out the creativity 
            in Barney's friends. While it's raining outdoors, the kids paint birds, 
            butterflies and caterpillars indoors. Then Barney displays the changing 
            seasons on his computer. Grabbing their umbrellas and singing, &quot;Rain, 
            Rain, Go Away,&quot; puts an end to the spring rain and a beginning 
            to the sunshine and a rainbow. The kids are ready for a spring fling 
            and have fun blowing bubbles and enjoying nature. Beth can't decide 
            what she likes best about spring, but she definitely doesn't like 
            the sneezing it brings. The kids join Barney for a picnic, including 
            some unexpected ant helpers who clean up as the group sings &quot;The 
            Ants Go Marching.&quot; Beth decides her favorite part of spring is 
            the birth of baby birds and animals in the spring season. It's always 
            the right season to learn and grow with Barney. <br>

            Baby Bop wants to play nurse to BJ and put bandages all over him, 
            but BJ is not injured. It does, however, provide the perfect opportunity 
            for Barney to remind the group that bandages are for real boo-boos 
            and to review safety rules for playgrounds and parks. As the song 
            says, &quot;Saying Be Careful Means I Love You.&quot; There are rules 
            to remember when playing ball, swinging, sliding and climbing. While 
            putting on a puppet show, the kids find that Mother Goose rhyme characters, 
            such as Humpty Dumpty and Jack &amp; Jill, weren't always careful 
            enough. Baby Bop continues to eagerly await a real boo-boo so she 
            can play nurse, and a rambunctious BJ isn't very careful about being 
            careful. When BJ trips over a toy, Baby Bop finally gets to bandage 
            a real boo-boo. Accidents may happen, but when they do, a little love 
            from Barney is just what the doctor ordered. <br>

            Barney's friends are playing hopscotch - but with a twist! It's Triangle 
            Hopscotch because Whitney is learning about triangles in school. When 
            Mario arrives in his new hiking boots, he explains that he's going 
            on a camping trip. While talking about the adventures they can have 
            outdoors, Barney encourages them to look around for triangles - on 
            the playset roof, the caboose door, and the toy sailboat. The Tee-rrific 
            Triangle Detective Team sings &quot;The Wonderful World of Shapes&quot; 
            as they search for triangles and make fun crafts from triangular shapes 
            - from butterflies to fish to jack-o-lanterns. When Mario makes a 
            triangular adventure hat, Barney takes them on an imaginary camping 
            trip. And there's nothing like triangular S'mores to start the trip 
            off right, as they continue to discover triangles in the world around 
            them. With Barney, it's always fun to learn new things! <br>

            Kami and Sarah are preparing for a bike parade. When Nick arrives, 
            they find he's had an accident on his bike. Barney and the girls cheer 
            Nick up, while Mr. Boyd offers to fix his bike. Baby Bop rides up 
            on her tricycle and proudly shows off her riding skills as she sings, 
            &quot;By Myself.&quot; Barney reminds them that whether you have one, 
            two, three, or four wheels, riding bicycles and tricycles is good 
            exercise. They soon discover there are lots of things with wheels 
            - from unicycles to rickshaws to bicycles built for two. Nick is impressed 
            with professional bike racers, which leads to a discussion with Mr. 
            Boyd about bicycle safety. Baby Bop helps decorate the bikes for the 
            parade, and they begin by making license plates. When Nick's bike 
            is fixed and Barney adds the finishing touch with balloons - the parade 
            is ready to roll! <br>

            It's an extra special day when Beth invents a new holiday called &quot;Happy 
            Day.&quot; The kids can make a wish for something that will make them 
            happy - and the others try to make the wish come true. Barney and 
            the kids discuss faces and feelings and the ways people show they're 
            happy - by laughing or hugging. Dogs wag their tails, and cats show 
            they're happy when they purr, which leads to singing &quot;Three Little 
            Kittens.&quot; When the kids pretend to be robots, they discover that 
            sad feelings are better than no feelings at all. BJ's wish to take 
            a fishing trip changes when Beth has an unexpected accident that makes 
            her &quot;Happy Day&quot; a sad one. When BJ throws a surprise party 
            for Beth, everyone is happy. Barney reminds the kids that the best 
            happiness of all is doing things for others. <br>

            Nick, Whitney and Gianna are invited to a picnic, but they don't know 
            who invited them. They're instructed to bring a family treasure, so 
            Nick shows them a toy truck that belonged to his father. Whitney's 
            treasure is a bracelet her grandmother gave her, and Gianna's treasures 
            are teddy bears - which leads to singing &quot;Teddy Bear Picnic.&quot; 
            Mario's family treasure is a book given to him by his brother. As 
            the children discuss types of families, they learn that families might 
            even include pet dogs! Barney explains that no matter the size, families 
            are people who love one another. Arriving at the picnic, they discover 
            that Barney sent their invitations and that he has a special surprise; 
            it's a family picnic, and their families were invited too! When asked

            A &quot;too hot&quot; afternoon becomes a &quot;totally cool&quot; 
            day when Barney introduces his friends to the wonderful world of water. 
            A cool drink at a water fountain leads to a discussion that water 
            is everywhere around them. Water is important for drinking and bathing, 
            and it's fun for playing in - as Captain BJ proves with the help of 
            his toy boat. Droopy flowers in the park get water from the kids, 
            and hot kids get nice cool lemonade from Angela. As they listen to 
            the watery sounds of an aquarium, they sing &quot;The Fishing Song&quot; 
            and &quot;If I Lived Under the Sea.&quot; The ultimate way to experience 
            water is to get into the swim of things with a real swimming pool 
            - which makes a big splash with the kids and is a good opportunity 
            to review swimming safety rules. Water is everywhere, and fun is anywhere

            The park is a home away from home for Barney and his friends, but 
            BJ wants to build his very own &quot;totally awesome, completely cool&quot; 
            house. While BJ works on his house, Barney teaches the kids about 
            houses and homes through songs such as &quot;That's A Home To Me&quot; 
            and by using his laptop computer to show them a variety of homes from 
            around the world. Following is an impromptu show about fanciful nursery 
            rhyme homes. When a picture puzzle of rooms in a house triggers a 
            series of make-believe activities, a toy kitchen yields yummy macaroni 
            and cheese, and a bubbling bathtub is the right place for Baby Bop's 
            bath. BJ thinks his house is finished but discovers he's forgotten 
            something and needs to make room for someone he loves - Baby Bop! 
            Barney reminds them that a family and loving friends make a house 
            a home. <br>
