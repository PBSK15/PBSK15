          <b>Suggested Grade Level:</b> Preschool-K <br>

          <b>Objectives:</b><br>
          One of the most exciting, as well as most meaningful, topics for young 
          children is their home. A home is a source of security - a place to 
          eat and sleep with people that love you. There are many types of homes 
          (house, apartment, mobile home, houseboat, townhouse). Children are 
          interested in learning about all kinds of homes. <br>
          <br>
          <b>The children will: </b> </font>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">know that a home is 
              where a family lives, eats, and sleeps (some children live with 
              divorced parents in two homes) </font>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">learn that there are 
              many types of homes: house, apartment, mobile home </font>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">understand that homes 
              may be made from many materials - wood, brick, stone, mud </font>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">learn that most houses 
              have one or more rooms - named for how it's used - bedroom, living 
              room, bathroom, dining room, kitchen </font>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">know that a group of 
              houses where families live near each other is called a neighborhood 
              </font>
          </ul>

          </ul>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Directions:</b><br>
          Discuss the many types of homes children live in. On a large map, locate 
          the school, neighborhoods, and even individual homes. After discussing 
          the many types of homes, divide students into four groups. Each group 
          will present their own play. <br>
          <br>
          They can make backdrops to define the house they are demonstrating. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Here are four nursery rhymes, one for each group: <br>
          <b><br>
          "Peter Peter, Pumpkin Eater" </b><br>
          <br>
          Peter, peter, pumpkin-eater,<br>
          Had a wife and couldn't keep her;<br>
          He put her in a pumpkin shell,<br>
          And there he kept her very well. <br>
          <br>
          <b>"There Was a Crooked Man" </b><br>
          <br>
          There was a crooked man,<br>
          And he went a crooked mile,<br>
          He found a crooked sixpence<br>
          Beside a crooked stile;<br>
          He bought a crooked cat,<br>
          Which caught a crooked mouse,<br>
          And they all lived together <br>
          In a crooked little house. <br>
          <br>
          <b>"There Was An Old Woman" </b><br>
          <br>
          There was an old woman<br>
          Who lived in a shoe.<br>
          She had so many children<br>
          She didn't know what to do.<br>
          She gave them some soup<br>
          And slices of bread<br>
          She hugged them and kissed them<br>
          And put them to bed. <br>
          <br>
          <b>"A Cat Came Fiddling Out of a Barn" </b><br>
          <br>
          A cat came fiddling out of a barn,<br>
          With a pair of bagpipes under her arm<br>
          She could sing nothing but fiddle-dee-dee,<br>
          The mouse has married the bumblebee.<br>
          Pipe, cat;<br>
          Dance, mouse;<br>
          We'll have a wedding at our good house. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Extension:</b><br>
          Set up the block center as a construction site. You may include props 
          such as a construction hat and hang up pictures of different types of 
          homes. Encourage students to build a neighborhood full of as many different 
          types of homes as possible. </font> </blockquote>
