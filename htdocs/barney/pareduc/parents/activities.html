          Long ago, conductors used flags to guide trains along the tracks. Make 
          a flag by decorating construction paper and taping it to a pencil or 
          dowel rod. Wave the flag just like conductors did in the past.</font> 
          <p></p>

          Sing the following train songs with your child: &quot;I've Been Working 
          on the Railroad,&quot; &quot;Down by the Station,&quot; and &quot;Little 
          Red Caboose.&quot; Add props, such as bandannas, engineer caps, lanterns 
          and gloves to help in pretend play while singing the songs.</font>

          Watch a kite fly up, up, up, and then come down, down, down! Choose 
          a windy day and a large open area to fly a large, diamond-shaped kite. 
          Once the kite is airborne, your child will probably be able to handle 
          it alone.</font>

          needed to help teach the child how to be thoughtful and respectful by

          bathroom scale, a stethoscope, adhesive bandages and a dog leash.</font> 
          <p></p>

          Have your child draw a picture of a pet that he/she would like to have 
          someday. As your child describes the pet to you, print his/her words 
          on the picture. Ask questions to prompt discussion. &quot;Where would 
          the pet live? What would you feed it?&quot;</font>

          Dock&quot;</strong><br>
          Help your child create a grandfather clock with a shoebox. Lay the box 
          on a table vertically. On the top third of the box, draw the face of 
          a clock. On the bottom two-thirds of the box, draw a large rectangle 
          with a pendulum hanging down. Recite the rhyme, &quot;Hickory, Dickory

          <br>
          <strong>Box Cars</strong><br>
          Remove the top and bottom from a large cardboard box. Use what is left 
          for the car. Attach painted paper plates (headlights, wheels, steering 
          wheel) with brads, and paint the car. Attach a strap on either side 
          of the car to serve as a shoulder harness. Add a &quot;seat belt&quot; 
          by attaching an old belt. (Remember that young children should be supervised 
          when playing with belts.)</font>

          Cut a round shape from poster board or other sturdy paper. Print STOP 
          (in capital letters). Have your child color the background red. Tape 
          or glue a craft stick as a handle. Make another sign with the word GO 
          and the background green. Your child will have fun reading or recognizing 
          the words STOP and GO.</font> 
          <p></p>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>STOP and GO To Music</strong><br>
          Play various types of music (classical, rock and roll, polka, jazz,

          Pack everything in a basket for a picnic outside. This is even fun indoors

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cooking Together</strong><br>
          It's fun to cook or bake one of your family's favorite recipes together. 
          Even a very young child can add some of the ingredients, stir, pour 
          or measure. Some children may be able to read the numbers on a measuring 
          cup or recipe card. Encourage your child to share the food with your 
          family or with a friend. Young children need opportunities to learn 
          to share and to feel good about themselves.</font>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Water Flowers</strong><br>
          Barney and his friends learned how important water is to flowers (and 
          people!) Everyone felt better after getting a drink of water. Your child 
          will enjoy helping water flowers. If possible, give your child a small 
          watering can (or use a large one with a small amount of water). Help 
          him/her water flowers, bushes and grass.</font>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Stuffed Fish</strong><br>
          Put two sheets of 12&quot; x 18&quot; manila or construction paper together. 
          Draw a simple outline of a large fish. Cut out the fish through both 
          sheets of paper. Staple the edges halfway around. Decorate both sides 
          with markers or crayons. Stuff fish with crumpled newspaper. Staple 
          the remaining edges.</font>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pretend House</strong><br>
          BJ had fun making a &quot;really cool house!&quot; Your child can make 
          his/ her very own &quot;really cool house&quot; too! Use a large cardboard 
          box (a refrigerator-sized box is great!) to make a pretend house with 
          a door and windows. Your child can decorate with print, markers, or 
          crayons. Accessories from your house will help make this a fun and creative 
          play experience.</font> 
          <p></p>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Make a Helper Chart</strong><br>
          List a few things your child can do to help around the house. Some examples 
          may include:</font> 
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Picking up toys,</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Placing dirty clothes 
              in a hamper,</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Making a bed,</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Helping set the table,</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Emptying small wastepaper 
              baskets.<br>
              </font></li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The number of responsibilities 
          will depend on your child's age. Hang the list in your child's bedroom, 
          on the refrigerator, or some other place that's easily seen. </font>
