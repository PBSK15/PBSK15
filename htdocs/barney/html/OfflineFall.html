The most visible of all changes is the colorful autumn leaves.  When green leaves change to red, orange, yellow, and brown, it is obvious to the very youngest child that fall is in the air.  To celebrate the changing leaves and the season of autumn, we hope you and your child will enjoy these fun and easy activities.<P><B>Fall wreath</B><BR><P>Collect several large paper grocery bags.  Cut out the bottom and down one side of each bag.  Thoroughly wet the paper bags and crumple them.  Spread them flat to dry.  After they have dried, cut leaf shapes out of the papers, and then sponge-paint the leaves in fall colors.  When the paint is dry, arrange the leaves on a circular piece of construction paper.  Hang it as a welcome sign for all visitors!</P><P><B>Leaf card game</B><BR><P>Go outside and collect five pairs of matching leaves and one leaf that doesn't match at all.  Press the leaves by laying them between paper towels and stacking books on top.  In a few days, the leaves should be ready to glue onto index cards.  Use the cards to play a variation of "Old Maid."  Pass out the cards so they are divided among all the players.  In turn, each player picks a card from the person on the left and then lays down any matching pair.  Continue until all the pairs are matched.  Whoever is left holding the odd leaf wins.<P><B>Leaf centerpiece</B><BR><P>Make a centerpiece out of autumn leaves.  Collect leaves of all shapes and sizes.  Stick leaves, pine cones, and sticks into a lump of clay.  When finished, place the centerpiece on the table.  It will be a nice addition to the dinner table.</P><P><B>Leaf blowing</B><P>Go outside with your child and choose a leaf.  Tilt your heads back, holding the leaves just above your mouths and puff as hard as you can.  See how long you and your child can keep the leaves floating before they hit the ground.</P><P><B>Leaf critters</B><BR>Gather leaves of all sizes, shapes and colors.  Glue them onto a piece of colored paper.  Encourage your child to use his/her imagination to make the leaves into people, animals, or anything!  Next, have your child draw a design or picture around the leaf creature.  Ask your child to tell you about his/her picture.  Does the creature have a name?  What does it eat?<P><B>Leaf comparison</B><P>After collecting leaves outside, compare and sort them by looking at their colors and shapes.  How many leaves are red?  Orange?  Brown?  Yellow?</P><P><B>Leaf mosaics</B><P>Crumple dry, colorful leaves into small pieces and glue them onto paper in mosaic patterns.  </P><P><B>Leaf crowns</B><BR>Cut a piece of construction paper so that it is about four inches tall and long enough to fit around your child's head.  Help your child glue autumn leaves onto the construction paper.  When the glue is dry, tape the construction paper in a circle so that it will fit on your child.  Your child will have fun wearing this leaf crown! <P><B>Leaf dance</B><BR>When walking through a park or the woods on an autumn day, notice how the leaves fall.  Do they fall straight down, or do they twirl?  Encourage your child to imitate a falling leaf.  				<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="200"></CENTER><P><B>October</B><br>									<B>Barney Says: Take some time to talk with your child about Halloween.</B><UL><LI>What would you like to be this year for Halloween?<LI>What is your favorite part of Halloween?<LI>Do you know some Halloween safety rules?</UL><P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="200"></CENTER><P><B>Good Books to Read:You and your child will have fun reading these stories together:</B><br><br><I>Baby Bop Pretends</I> by Mary Ann Dudko and Margie Larsen, Barney Publishing.Baby Bop pretends as she dresses up in all kinds of different clothes.<br><br><I>Barney's Halloween Party</I> by Mary Ann Dudko and Margie Larsen, Barney Publishing.Barney and his friends have fun at a Halloween party.<br><br><I>Barney's Trick or Treat</I> by Mark Bernthal, Barney Publishing.It's Halloween night, and Barney, BJ and Baby Bop are ready to howl!
