									</font><BR><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>April/May:  Fun With Music<P>
									</b>
									<B>Singing with props</B>
									<BR>Choose one prop that can be used while singing a favorite song.  For example, use an umbrella while singing a rainy day song, a small bucket or pail while singing "Jack and Jill," or hats, scarves, and other simple props to enhance any song.


<P><B>"Miss Mary Mack"</B><BR>
<P>
This traditional street chant is fun to clap to while singing.  Sit facing your child.  Clap your hands once, slap your thighs once, clap your hands once, and pat each other's hands three times.
</P>


<P>
"Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack, <BR>
All dressed in black, black, black, <BR>
With silver buttons, buttons, buttons, <BR>
All down her back, back, back. <BR>
</P>


<P>
Well, she asked her mother, mother, mother, <BR>
For fifteen cents, cents, cents, <BR>
To see the elephants, elephants, elephants, <BR>
Jump the fence, fence, fence. <BR>
</P>


<P>
Well, they jumped so high, high, high, <BR>
They touched the sky, sky, sky, <BR>
And never came back, back, back, <BR>
Till the fourth of July, ly, ly!" <BR>
(traditional)
</P>


									<P><B>"John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt"</B>
									<BR><P>
Sing this song softly until after the word "shout."  Then sing the ending loudly.  Another idea is to sing the song four times.  The first time, sing it in a loud voice.  The second time, sing it using the same volume that you use when you talk.  The third time, sing it softly, and the last time, sing it using a whisper.
</P>

<P>
"John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt, <BR>
His name is my name too. <BR>
Whenever I go out, <BR>
The people always shout, <BR>
'There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt!' <BR>
Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da!" <BR>
(words and music traditional) <BR>
</P>

									<P><B>"B-I-N-G-O"</B>
									<BR><P>
"Bingo" is a simple song that all family members can sing.  To help your child learn the song, write the name BINGO across the top of a large sheet of art paper or poster board.  Ask your child to draw a dog below.  Point to the letters as you sing together.
</P>

<P>
"B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O <BR>
And Bingo was his name, oh!"
</P>


									<P><B>"Johnny Works With One Hammer"</B>
									<P>
Sing this fun song, substituting your child's name for Johnny.
</P>

<P>
"Johnny works with one hammer, <BR>
One hammer, one hammer, <BR>
Johnny works with one hammer, <BR>
Then he works with two." <BR>
</P>


<P>
Continue, starting each verse with the next number.  Try these movements as you sing: <BR><BR>
1st verse:  move one hand up and down in a hammering motion. <BR>
2nd verse:  move both hands up and down in a hammering motion. <BR>
3rd verse:  move both hands and one leg up and down in a hammering motion. <BR>
4th verse:  move both hands and both legs up and down in a hammering motion. <BR>
5th verse:  move both hands, both legs, and head up and down in a hammering motion, ending with: 
</P>


<P>
"Then he works no more!" <BR>
(words and music traditional)
</P>


									<P><B>Moving to music</B>
									<BR>Play various styles of music (classical, rock & roll, polka, jazz, reggae, country western) and have your child move to the beat of the music.

									<P><B>Ribbon dance</B>
									<BR>Give your child a long ribbon or scarf.  Play different kinds of music that your child can dance and move to.

									<P><B>Kitchen band</B>
									<BR>There are many musical instruments available in your very own kitchen!  Try these:  tap a wooden spoon on pots, pans, or plastic bowls; shake a securely closed plastic container full of rice or beans; tap two spoons together to make an interesting noise; use old pot lids as cymbals.  Experiment with rhythms (fast and slow) and with loud and soft sounds.  Play some music and play along to the beat of the song.

									<P><B>Marching band</B>
									<BR>Play a rousing march.  You and your child can take turns leading the parade, marching to the beat.  Added props might include flags to wave, a baton and a toy drum.

									<P><B>Shaker</B>
									<BR>Decorate two paper plates with markers or crayons.  Pour one-half cup dried beans or rice onto one of the plates.  Staple or tape the other paper plate on top.  Now you're ready to shake, shake, shake!

									<P><B>Guitar</B>
									<BR>To make a guitar, stretch two or three rubber bands lengthwise around an empty tissue box.  Attach a paper towel tube to one end of the box for the neck.  Strum the rubber bands and sing a favorite song.

									<P><B>Drum</B>
									<BR>Cover an oatmeal box or coffee can with construction paper and decorate.  Use another piece of  construction paper (attached with a rubber band) or the box lid as the drum head.  Gently tap with fingers to the beat of the music.

									<P><B>Stone clappers</B>
									<BR>Look for stones that comfortably fit in your child's hands.  Clap them together as you sing favorite songs or march in a pretend parade.

									<P><B>Kazoo</B>
									<BR>Cover one end of a toilet paper tube with a small sheet of wax paper and secure it with a rubber band.  Hum into the open end.  Young children may need help learning to hum!
