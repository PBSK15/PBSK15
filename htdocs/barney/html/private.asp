<P>
If you use this website to order products, submit a subscription or enter a drawing or contest, information you provide may be shared with our contract service providers, which currently include Yahoo! Inc. and CDS, both of which assist us in processing your orders.  Any such information will be subject to our control, and will be used only as described below.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>2.	The information we collect and how we use it -- </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We will specifically ask for any information that personally identifies your child or you or allows us to contact your child or you.  This kind of information is generally requested when you are purchasing products, submitting a subscription, or entering a contest or drawing.  We specifically request that the parent or caregiver enter his or her own information, rather than a child's, in connection with any of these actions.  This information will be stored and will be used to send e-mail updates about Barney-related products and events.  If you wish to stop receiving these updates, or even to have your information deleted entirely, you may simply send us an e-mail request to that effect, and we will promptly comply.
<P>
We will sometimes request that you provide your child's name, gender and birthdate, but we <U>never</U> require this information.  At some places on the website, a child's first name will be requested.  When a child's name is provided in response to such a request, we use it only to personalize the screen so that the child's name will appear in storylines, on pictures and the like.  If you choose not to provide the child's name, the references will, instead, be to &quot;friend.&quot;  If you provide the child's name, it will be automatically deleted when you close your Internet browser.
<P>
If you provide a child's name when you subscribe to the Barney Buddies Club, those mailings will be sent in the child's name.  If you provide a child's name to send an electronic greeting card from this website, the card will be sent to the e-mail address you designate, and the child's name will show in the subject line of the e-mail.  If you choose to provide your child's gender and date of birth, that information will be used only to help us evaluate the demographics of our audience. 
<P>
It is never possible for a third party to access your child's name when it is up on our website.
<P>
Some limited information may also be automatically collected (unless you have set your computer's preferences to prevent it) whenever you log onto our website, through what are known as &quot;cookies.&quot;  In the computer world, cookies are small text files that may be placed on your hard drive by a website server.  These files cannot determine your name, e-mail address, phone number or any other personal information about you unless you choose to provide that information.  Instead, a &quot;cookie&quot; is able to store information about your computer and the online activities generated from it, such as what kind of browser software you use to access the Internet, the type of operating system, and the domain name of your Internet service provider.  &quot;Cookies&quot; help website operators do things like count the number of &quot;hits&quot; on their websites, and know which of those &quot;hits&quot; are repeat visits from the same computer.  Beyond this sort of anonymous information, &quot;cookies&quot; contain only information that you choose to provide.  For example, if you visit a website that requires a password, but you are able to enter a password and then store it so that you don't have to type it in every time, that information is probably held in a &quot;cookie.&quot;  A &quot;cookie&quot; can <U>only</U> be read by the server that leaves it on your hard drive.
<P>
We use &quot;cookies&quot; to count the number of visitors to our website, determine which of the activities on our site are most popular, and assess whether our site is compatible with the computer capabilities of our visitors.  We may also, from time to time, use &quot;cookies&quot; to give visitors the ability to personalize the website for their child, or to track and provide visitor scores on designated contests or multi-player games.  This information is used only for the purpose of operating the website and administrative and research functions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>3.	Sharing information with third parties - </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We don't, period.  Under no circumstances do we disclose any of the information we collect - about your child or you - with anyone other than our contract service providers.  Even they have access only to the information necessary to process your product orders or subscriptions, and they cannot use that information for any other purpose.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>4.	Information required to participate - </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We do not and cannot require any information about your child in order for the child to participate in any of the activities on this website.  As noted above, if you choose not to input your child's name when requested on activity screens, references that would have been to the child's name will be to &quot;friend.&quot;  We require from parents and caregivers only the information reasonably necessary if they wish to subscribe to the Barney Buddies Club, order products or enter drawings.  No information about your child is required for any of those purposes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>5.	Reviewing information - </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You may at any time review, make changes to or delete any information about your child that we have stored on our system.  If you wish to do so, please send a written request to the street address (<U>not</U> e-mail address) shown above, Attention: Information Practices, <U>together with</U> a photocopy of your driver's license or other government issued identification (so that we may verify to whom we are providing your child's information).  If you wish to receive a response via regular mail, please include a stamped, self-addressed envelope.  If you wish to receive an e-mail response, please provide a password by which we may protect access to the response, which we will send as an attached document. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This site was created as an educational, entertaining and child-friendly environment.  We encourage you to closely monitor your children's Internet activities.  We also ask that you contact us immediately if you have any concerns about this site or believe that any information you have provided to us has been used or provided in a manner other than as described above.
