  <p>EekoWorld features fifteen lesson plans. There are three lessons for each grade level from kindergarten through grade four. The lesson plans contain the following components: overviews, grade level, learning objectives, building background activities, learning activities, extension activities, and standards. The educational standards for all the lessons are compiled by grade ranges from K-2 and 3-5. Therefore, you may wish to explore lessons other than those specific to the grade level class you teach. The following section describes the lesson plans for each of the grade levels.</p> <br> <a name="lessonk"></a><span class="subhead">Kindergarten Lessons</span><br>
