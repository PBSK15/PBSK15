If I take a bath, I don't fill it up all the way. I try to take showers for 5 minutes or less, and I NEVER keep the water on while I brush my teeth!!</p> <p>— zalaya, Age 12</p>
      <hr> <p>i saved water by taking sort showers and turning off the water when i am not using it</p> <p>— alexa, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>When I am getting a drink of water, I make sure that I don't take too much because sometimes you want a tiny sip of water when you took a whole cup! So you pour it down the drain, right? NO! Sometimes I do, but you should really give the rest to an indoor plant so they can have a drink!</p> <p>— joybug667, Age 12</p>
      <hr> <p>i love eekoworld and its a great place to learn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i'll try to let my family go green by doing all dis stuff.i'll leave a note on the fridge and let them know about the website and surly they will be happy about what theve learned from their little girl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GO GREEN!!!!!</p> <p>— trickmama112, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>i take showers with my mommy so it uses less water two ways! 1) one less shower 2) less water then taking a bath yeah i'm saving the earth when i'm 4 what can you do when your 10 or 11? ill be saving the eat=rth my whole life</p> <p>— sammantha, Age 3</p>
      <hr> <p>At home I always turn off the water when I brush my teeth, we also use rain barrels to water our garden, we even have a low flow shower head.</p> <p>— pingpong1000, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>My family is very conservative of water. We save all that we can. In addition to saving the water, it also saves us money on our water bill! When we take a bath, we only use 3 inches of water, and when we take a shower, we have limited time. Also, when brushing our teeth, we turn off the water while we brush and only use it when we rinse. Believe it or not, my family actually doesn't even own a dishwasher. That is part of my chores. I think that it takes less time though, after you load it and unload it and wait for them to wash, I could have them done! I hope some of the things we do will help you too!</p> <p>— SparkleSport, Age 13</p>
      <hr> <p>I learned that evry time you have spare water, throw it to the plants.</p> <p>— Numba10gIRL, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>I usually i take quick showers and and drink bottled water and trying to use the bathroom once a day and wash dishes by hand we also give are cats and frogs bottled water.</p> <p>— grandpatoby, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>WARNING: READ THIS! Hi, I'm Caroline and if you're taking showers before you go to bed and you feel they're to long, here's a tip: Plug the drain when you take a shower. At the end of the shower, get all your house plants next to the shower/bathtub. Get out a watering can and fill it up WITH THE WATER IN THE SHOWER/BATHTUB. Do this at regular baths. This way, you're taking a shower/bath and wasting no water! If you don't have any house plants, buy seeds from the store or take the water outside and water your community's plants. Read About plants so you know how much water to put on each plant. Start a local garden and your friends will knoe</p> <p>— Caroline C, Age 7</p>
