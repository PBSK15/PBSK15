My family does recycle to save trees and I have been trying to convince my family into flipping over used papers but, my dad throws it away, and also I am still trying to convince my dad into recycling. We do turn off lights. We also do turn off the water and save it. But, I will convince my parents to install a low-flush toilet and a low sprinkle shower. Yes, I will always hang my clothes to save energy, and this computer I am typing on has a rechargeable battery, that's all for now.</p> <p>— wishwell1234, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>i love the ekohouse cause there is a magizine to learn about things!!!!!!!</p> <p>— gemelee, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>I think EekoHouse teaches us about recycling and reducing household items, like paper cups or plastic bottles. Its right or wrong answers are very convenient. I love to recycle, and with this feature I learned how to recycle and reduce more.</p> <p>— IceWhistle/Gabby, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>Dear aw123456, I totally disagree. Cheeko is funny, but he does NOT tell bad jokes. I don't know if you mean bad jokes as in dirty jokes or just jokes that aren't funny, but either way you're wrong. ROCK ON, CHEEKO!</p> <p>— horsekrazyg, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>how do you go to eekoschool?brainpopjr dose not have an exchange so its' cool.</p> <p>— sophia, Age 6</p>
      <hr> <p>iTS AMAZING THAT I CAN LEARN HOW TO SAVE WATER AND POWER IN TEN MINUTES.</p> <p>— lily, Age 7</p>
      <hr> <p>I must admit, sometime in the house, we aren't smart enough to think about the good and the bad things we do in our precious houses. Even I didn't know that washing your cars in your very own driveway was such a environment hurting thing to do. I guess we just thought about these two things: saving money on car washes and we also thought about trying to keep our antennas in good shape ( the car washes are very rough and they bend and break our antennas on our car) that's why i thank our helpful little Eekohouse.</p> <p>— Darego8899, Age 13</p>
      <hr> <p>i like eekhouse because you get to clean the house and the garage.</p> <p>— smileed, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>I think Eeko house was made to show the importance of being Eco friendly. Also it shows us that even kids can make a difference at our homes every day. We can do a lot of things to save the environment by just flipping a light switch. What do you think?</p> <p>— Maniti, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>It is fun and it helps learn. I before I new about eecoworldi would aiiways play webkins and nowall i play is eecoworld.</p> <p>— llebreknit, Age 9</p>
