I love learning how to keep the earth clean, and knowing that other people are learning to makes it that much better! Go green!</p> <p>— kirakira101, Age 12</p>
      <hr> <p>I love eeko house because I leaned about what I can do to help the enviorment, us at home, and the money me and my mom had. Gess what cheeko, my mom on spring breake had only 100 dollars! (I think it was because of how much my sister leaves on lights and the TV. Oh, when Icame home I saw the TV was on and then I remered what you taught me today and I turned of the TV and my sister ither left yesterday and left the TV on the whole time we where gone or she forgot to turn of the TV on Friday! Well I will remined my sister to turn of the lights and the TV.</p> <p>— cda10, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>I thing it's a very nice game because it shows kids in diffrent ages.....it also shows how to cut off things before you leve.</p> <p>— trini4567, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>Save energy. WOW . I never new that this was eekoworld and when I first visted it I saw eekoworld house and I was great at it.</p> <p>— sofia845, Age 6</p>
      <hr> <p>I think it´s a cool way to find out what´s good and right for the environment and smaller kids start to understand that we need to take care of the world for future life</p> <p>— pbskids783, Age 12</p>
      <hr> <p>I think that eekohouse teaches kids how to save energy at your house, and it's fun!! I also think the dog is cute. It's adorable!!! It's very cool to have a computer in your room. If anyone does, I hope they don't play on it so much. Also, every kid needs to save energy. If they forget to turn off a light, they must always check to see if they turned off the light before they do somthing else!!!</p> <p>— eko234, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>I've got an idea. Let's all get a square box and paint it or color it with markers to look like a recycle bin. Then we can put scrap paper ( or loose notebook paper), egg cartons, cleaned dried soda and water bottles, milk/ juice cartons, blank cardboard squares, and old envelopes, etc in it! The scrap paper and envelopes can be used to scribble notes on, and the bottles, cardboard, cartons, and other things can be used for crafts!! The box could be filled and used by the whole family! If you've got pet rabbits, big (or little) soda bottles are great for water bottle for the rabbits. That's what we do for most of our rabbits! I think (if I can find a permanent place) I'll make a cardboard recycling bin for the whole house!! :-D</p> <p>— horsekrazyg, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>i'm glad there is eekohouse it helps people know about our planet earth and all the things we can do to help it. Some things i've never even known!</p> <p>— jss4156, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>I rthink eeko world is an edicational web site that helps people know the smat way to live eeko friendly.Wuth this sight we can have fun while laering .The activities are great even if you are 4 or 42 this is something you can do.</p> <p>— mccarpente, Age 12</p>
