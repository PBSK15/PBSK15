Name: The Transformer Machine. (Also,it pops out tree, flower, fruits, and vegatable seeds you can plant! Go Green!)</p> <p>— Gr8grl18, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>i would make a car that can be conected to other cars and it doesent use gas it uses water and it flys as well so you dont have to use a plane!!</p> <p>— wendywicth, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>i want to invent a car that has 2 huge vacumes that sucks up trash along the road and not natural things .....neat huh</p> <p>— cryptonic, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>I would invent a machine called the Recycler.It would turn recycle things in to things that are awesome.</p> <p>— PBozzuto, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>i would create a robot that sucked up anything that is not eco friendly.</p> <p>— eco helper, Age 7</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make a cloneing machine to make more animals. I would also make a big fence out of recycled materiels to make sure nobody enters parkland with endangered speices living there.</p> <p>— Tarkles, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make a machine that would plant trees. I would put in paper and push a button. I would also have a button that prints out a paper that says, stop making trash and recycle. Cheeko, thanks a million.</p> <p>— snowflake, Age 3</p>
      <hr> <p>I THINK I WOULD MAKE A SOLAR POWERED PHONE SO I COULD TALK AALL I WANT WITHOUT WASTING ENERGY</p> <p>— AMH123, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make a solar/wind/(in aquatic ecosystems) water powered device with air and water filtration devices that would use robotic arms to clean up natural areas. It would have 2 batteries-1 to save energy for nights &amp; cloudy days with little wind when it's not near water, and another to store the extra electricity. It would be very energy efficent so as to save lots of energy in battery #2. Battery #2 would be for storing exess power for use elsewhere. It's main uses would be (1) to clean up natural areas and (2) a power generator. It would magneticaly interact with the earth's core in a way that would enable it to fly.</p> <p>— s12000, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make a machine that cleans up any trash and recycles it.It would clean up any harmful gas in the air.It would also water trees.</p> <p>— mythwolf, Age 11</p>
