      <hr> <p>I would invent a transporter machine so we would only need a small amount of energy to travel long distances. Not only would this decrease pollution and allow for much faster travel it would also make it easier to get food and medicine to poor people in distant lands. -Austin Age 11 Virginia</p> <p>— snowyclover, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>If I were to build a machine it would be a car that has no engine.But it works and you can steer it to.It just works on the wind thats blowing.</p> <p>— mikey, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make a machine that scans if any electricity or fossil fuels are being used to much and it will tell you to lower the electricity down if you have been wasting too much electricity.</p> <p>— stickfuse, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make a car that ran on sound.</p> <p>— Matthew, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>I would invent a machine that would scoop up garbage and reuse it!!!</p> <p>— Denith2, Age 7</p>
      <hr> <p>I'd invent vehicals that run purely on a magnet that penetrates the iron in the earth. I would arrange it in a repeling effect, lifting it of the ground. I would rotate the plate to go forward or backward.</p> <p>— Lincecum, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>A fling house that make energy from the sun/air/moving water!</p> <p>— hghfhdfh, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>i wold invent a machine that is like a lawn-mower but instead of cuting it puts holes and then seeds in the ground.</p> <p>— colby, Age 7</p>
      <hr> <p>i would make a machine that could look inside a tree and look in the annual rings and tell how old the tree is without hurting or cutting down the tree. that would mean that we could tell alot about the tree, like how much water was soaked up by the tree that year, and many more things. we will then know the history of that tree without distroying that important priesous tree. well, that's my idea!</p> <p>— sonyaiscool9, Age 9</p>
