     <td id="postings"><!-- ++++++++++++++BEGIN POSTINGS CONTENT++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ --> <img src="/eekoworld/images/exchange_det_machine.gif" alt="What machine would you invent to help the Earth?"> <p>I would invent a robot that uses old oil that people don't need. The robot also would detect when people throw away something that can be recycled and say "PUT IT IN THE RECYCLING BIN!!!!!!"</p> <p>— dectetive, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make a machine that when it sensed garbige or someone was doing somthing not ecofrendly or somthing not ecofrendly was fixed and was better.</p> <p>— cheyby, Age 7</p>
      <hr> <p>I would invent solor power things like trucks, vacums,camras,and ovens.</p> <p>— whiteflower6, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>I invent the switch earth it switch place to sick place to lovely place its switched the can on ground to can in recycle bin the switch is 1 minute to the ugly place to nice place it had a 2 recycle machine it had sucker trash it blow the trash into the bag the and the giant bin the recycle bin is giant it scoop up the garbage in the bin.</p> <p>— anthony, Age 6</p>
      <hr> <p>I would create a machine that runs on plastic bags and has sticks made out of recycled metal to pick up litter. it would have an air vent that sucks in smoke. it name would be 3eco</p> <p>— edoeddie, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>i would make a earth saver. it would go around the earth all over making eeko world healthyer.</p> <p>— madison, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>I would invent a trash AND recycling bin, all in one! 1) You open the lid by pressing down on the lever with your foot. 2) Drop whatever into the bin; like food, newspaper, a doll etc. 3) Release the lever by lifting up your foot. 4) Press the red button on the lid to tell the machine that you're all done, and that it can start sorting. 5) The machine then scans everything and disposes of it into the correct bin for you! This way no more guessing on what is what!</p> <p>— 8jewel8, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>I would invent something that fly's and there is no gas. The name will be jay bird JB for short. For girls it will be pink for boys it will be blue and it will stop any time it sees pollution and suck it up and then throw it away or recycle it. Any time it sees hunters it will brake anything in it's pocket's or hands that will hurt animals. Also any hurt animal it will take care and call the vet the person. who is driving or sitting in the passengers seat will be the one who is talking on the phone it is okay the jay bird will stop. If they don't really know where they are the jay bird will tell them and then the doctor will know where the animal is and take care of the animal. Now you probably think there is foot things to stop well it is peddles for like a bike you will get exercise instead of pressing hard on the other thing in a regular car. Also when you are done driving it you say your password hold down the blue or pink colored button on the right side of the JB then it will quickly shrink and leave you at the same size you came in as Then you have to clap your hands together then it will melt into the palm of your hand. Don't forget when you want it out you clap your hands together again say your password at the same time then it would form back into itself again you also have those swirly light bulbs inside for light of the JB we also have a timer for the lights so it will go off when the time runs out that is all about my invention called The Jay Bird. THE END P.S doesn't this computer wastes energy oh no! the environment monster has came to haunt me oh it's coming closer I am gonna shut the computer down in 3......2.......1......CLICK!</p> <p>— cutiepie302, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>would invent a watch that had a mini recycling plant on it. It would run on rechargable batteries. I would also have a mini wind geneorator that you could use.</p> <p>— sweetiejoy, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>i would invent a house that you can use less energy.</p> <p>— coolnick23, Age 8</p>
