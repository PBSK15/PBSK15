It picks up trash. Then it burns it by puting it in itself also it has lazer beam that burns trash.Then it invents anything it can with it. Also it uses the sun for energy. Like WallE.</p> <p>— Celloist99, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>To help the earth be for scool you could chek if evrey thing is turnned of or if evrey thing is running smothly and thwen the bus is here and you get to go to scool and learn something new evrey single day in your life you tot me that Eeko exept the bus is here you get to go to scool and learn something newevrey single day of your life!</p> <p>— abby, Age 2</p>
      <hr> <p>I would invent the one and only, Ceature*TM* Creator! I made this little sereise called Creatures, it has oh so many creatures that look so different. They can talk, you can capture them (as if they were pokemon, but with little crystals that inprison them inside it), they have a verioty of moves, you can decorate them, like with armor or hats, and give them weapons they fight other people's creatures. Once a creature is defeated, it will be sent back to it's natural habitate, or where ever you caught it. This is a good idea because it provides the whole world with new animals! This invention would be one of the best ones in science history!</p> <p>— CJ, Age 13</p>
      <hr> <p>i love plants and animals so i would make a robot that could talk to plants and animals and have a sound signal saying what the animal was saying so it could tell me what to do to help keep this beautiful state still stay beautiful but it could take 3 years or more to make it and i bet if you sold it,it would make over 80,000 dollars everyone could donate to help save plants and animals around the world like trees and flowers grass and even cactus and animals like bears lizard and even a very DANDEROUS animal the komato dragon and so i can't wait to build it</p> <p>— makynzi, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make something called The Cleaner-Upper 12,000. This machine could do small things like tidy up your house instantly, but it could do big things like clean up an ocean INSTANTLY!</p> <p>— Pradyot, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>i would make a mini machine that heats your clothes and it runs on cold air. it would also keep your clothes clean so that you don't have to buy more clothes!</p> <p>— garcemaura, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>i'd biuld a hovor bike instead of wheels two frizzbee-like plates at the bottom! that saves gas,mony and time (you can fly over trees and other stuff)!</p> <p>— eekocool, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>i say that if i invented a machine that makes trashcans, littering, and trash not exist, there would only be recycling</p> <p>— mmflood, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>A machine called the XP3000 it turns old things into anything you wish you could get it.</p> <p>— Maheen, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>I would create the Ekomania 2356 and it would filter salt water, clean up trash, make trash into fuels that can be used to run cars and make electricity.</p> <p>— Isaac, Age 9</p>
