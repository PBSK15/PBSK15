I would also make a machine that takes in carbon dioxide and turns it into oxygen for all of us to breath.</p> <p>— zebra667, Age 12</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make a machine that would pick up trash and would also help save endangered species of different types of animals, it might also help our enviorment without using chemicals or polute the ecosystem</p> <p>— BigPappi34, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>I would build a car that runs on watermelon juice! That way you wouldn't have to use gas and it would smell better!</p> <p>— fun4me02, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make a robotic tree that would take all carbon-based gases and turn it into oxegen-based gases and if trash touches it's roots, EVEN oil, it will recycle the trash as quickly as it can.</p> <p>— Nathaniel, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make a recycling robot that uses 1 hour of sunlight to last the entire day finding and recycling old products. It would be solar powered. If there is no sun, it would use either rain or wind to continue recycling the whole day.</p> <p>— superjohnny600, Age 12</p>
      <hr> <p>I would create a machine that was exactly like a car, only it didn't use polluting chemicals to move! It would run on the suns electricity instead, which would help alot... and if we want to move at night we could use the moon or something. This would help keep the air clean and it wouldn't put nasty chemicals in the air!</p> <p>— IceCream62, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>I would make a machine called THE RECYCLING MACHINE.It will pick up all of the paper and plastic and will put it in your recycling bin.I will be in the World Record Book!LOL!</p> <p>— tufany2, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>i would envent a macine called the freindly macine it would fly around the earth and pick up trash and it would also make people stop being mean.</p> <p>— hollymolly49, Age 7</p>
      <hr> <p>I would create a timer to put into computers. After about 30 min. the computer will shut off, and the next time it's used, the timer will reset. It would be great for kids.</p> <p>— ms310, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>i would make a car that doesn't run on gas but solar power and spits out air that we breath</p> <p>— cat, Age 14</p>
