      <hr> <p>our school recycles paper. every week we have a contest to see which class recycled the most.</p> <p>— tata5555, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>Well...my school recycles lots of things that are not good for the enviorment such as poison we made a laser in my class that burns poison only poison. And we recycle things that people throw away. And we go outside on streets,and everywhere else to pick up the trash the that the other people who dont like to recycle in the recycling bin. The people who don't recycle they will have to sign up for the global warming community because they will recive forms that they will have to sign. So each week they will recive a mail from the global warming to tell them which street or some place else where they have to go to pick up the thrown away trash. Also my class goes on field trips to recycling companys. My school is a recycling school they always tell us when we grow up we will work for global warming. That is the only recycling place to work at and our collage will be at the Dallas Fort Worth recycling collage. I have been that greatest student since kindergarten. I have been listening for recycling directions my whole life. I never knew that i was going to be a recycling child from when i was born to until i was 5 years old. This website made me smart about recycling. So i study at this site for good grades. Oh and i forgot to tell you that i am a straight A+ student smartest of them all.</p> <p>— loveaajkal, Age 9</p>
