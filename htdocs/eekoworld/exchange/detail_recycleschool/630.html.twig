      <hr> <p>my school recycles milk cartons ,banana peelings,the plastic bags we have our oranges and pears in to reuse them again we have reuseable trays instead of plastic that do not decompose in the landfills that have trash.we have our teacher tells us to use the front and back of our paper so they will not have to waste and cut down trees.the teachers also tell us toreuse penccils and not get a new pencil every day so we will not be wasting wood.thats what my school does and i hope you and your familes and yourschool can do the same.thank you very much</p> <p>— lovetolearn6, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>At my old school in TX (before we moved), we had a program and we would save Capri Sun pouches and cookie and chip bags. All I would throw away was a straw and my sandwich bag. We recycled paper, but I don't know what else. Where I live now, we reuse trays (I think we do), recycle paper, lunch-able packs, and Capri Sun pouches. Whats cool about that program is that the people who run it turn used food packs into bags, clipboards, holiday bows, and other cool things.</p> <p>— Jelzie, Age 9</p>

      <hr> <p>My school recycles more than 50, millon papers a day!And my school also makes us able to donate money to poor people and when ever we donate that money away poor people use that money to perchuse things in need like warm coats and food and homes.I love recycling because it saves the earth and us.</p> <p>— lightning812, Age 7</p>
      <hr> <p>My school recycles box-tops, (I'm pretty sure all of you out there know what those are) and extra paper what we don't need; like when we (me and a friend) were staple-ing tests together, and we had extra paper for it, then my teacher said to put it in the "Drawing Paper" box, which is recycling.</p> <p>— bethmock, Age 11</p>
