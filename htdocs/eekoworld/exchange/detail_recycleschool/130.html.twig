      <hr> <p>In my school's cafeteria, we have 2 people (I do it on wednesdays) who are part of the school's Green Team, sit by the trash and recycling cans, and tell people to pour out their drinks such as milk into the special orange buckets, and then recycle! Once we get this down, we're gonna have a compost, which would be SUPER cool!</p> <p>— aolso4, Age 12</p>
      <hr> <p>Dear EekoWorld Members, Our school has become a Michigan Green School. It's not that hard! Really! We just have Green Tuesday, which is where we have a can drive in front of the buses. We also do the Siemens, We Can Change The World Project. I would google it, and ask your teacher if you may do it next year. Continue Saving Mother Earth! ~Crowblaze~</p> <p>— crowblaze, Age 11</p>
