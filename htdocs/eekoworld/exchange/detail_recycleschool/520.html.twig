      <hr> <p>I think if my school tries hard enough we can make a difference in this world. And keep the Earth clean by reducing reusing and recycling. If we try hard enough the world would be a better more beautiful place to live and breathe. wouldn't that be cool if everyone would just keep this place clean there is only one earth to live on so we should keep it eko friendly while we still have it or else you will miss the great things you could have done but didn't and let you and the earth suffer. so please keep our homes and the animals homes clean. that would make everyone happy.</p> <p>— eino, Age 13</p>
