      <hr> <p>I think cuting trees down is bad for the Environment. I think making the trees into paper is bad too! I think we should plant more trees. And we should stop polluting the air. Over 95% of trees have been cut down. I think we can help! Lets help the Earth.</p> <p>— Abbeyrose, Age 6</p>
      <hr> <p>hello every one how was your day</p> <p>— allysen23, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>eating organic is hard</p> <p>— kamschuylo11, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>I love to act. I have been acting since I was 6 or 7 years old. It is really fun!</p> <p>— Sophia, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>I really want to organize a community clean up. And while im at it, I can plant a tree! do you agree? I also want to walk or ride a bike. I can keep a compost bin and turn vegetable scrappings and fruits into healthy stuff for the planet! I want to put out food for animals like birds and squirrels. did you know me and my friends, Aleah and Cara, made a club in gifted class? It is called squirrel scouts. we gather acorns in the summer, spring, and fall. Near the end of fall,we put out the acorns for the squirrels to eat. Then we leave them alone and let them hibernate. The squirrel Scouts are really fun! And also there is a game we play every week called squirrel scotch. Its like hopscotch but with acorns.Aleah and I even planted an acorn seed! It was so much fun!I love helping the Earth. How about you? Well, I gotta go keep the Earth clean! Bye!</p> <p>— chomp12grand, Age 9</p>
