      <hr> <p>Hey everyone, Cheeko here! I’m making big plans to celebrate World Water Day on Monday March 22nd. I think I’ll pick up trash by the river and sing songs about water all day! What great ideas do you have for saving water and keeping it clean?! – Cheeko, Age 8</p> <p>— Cheeko, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>people should recycle more than they throw away trash, then you wouldn't much trash but some people get kind of tired of washing the dishes all day so we use paper plates,BUT! paper plates are just building up more trash.This is whats causing people to liter.Some people just liter because they don't feel like throwing anything away.Well.........If we recycle more we wouldn't have to worry about throwing anything in the trash now would we?No we won't.What i do is i use recycling bens instead of trash cans and i use glass plates and silver spoons and nives and i am a very earth protecting girl i dont likie to see people liter at all! sometimes me and my sister help my aunt with her job she works for a No Litering Policy wich is when people go around picking up trash from off the ground and they do this for a living they make 16 dallors an hour and it is a job that everyone could do and kids would probaly do it for free but PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD NEED TO MAKE THIS EARTH A BETTER PLACE CAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY EARTH WE HAVE TO STAND ON SO MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE!</p> <p>— imaurie10, Age 10</p>
      <hr> <p>WE should stop producing trash by not buying a lot of food that comes in packages made out of styerfoam. and we should stop buying foam cups and buy/bring more glass cups.</p> <p>— spooks23, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>We can all create less trash by NOT eating anything that comes in nonrecycable things.</p> <p>— goldmist9, Age 9</p>
