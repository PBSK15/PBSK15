      <hr> <p>how do you get into the hall of fame?!?!?!?i mean come on i got all of the creatures but no hall of fame!who here knows!i will sniff you out and tickle you untill you tell me!so tell me willingly! galaxar out</p> <p>— sp43, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>how many points do you need to get in the hall of fame</p> <p>— 411ekko, Age 6</p>
      <hr> <p>I love that idea it is both fun educational and encouraging to save the earth and at the same time you get to play a fun game. I really like it.</p> <p>— Mary, Age 11</p>
      <hr> <p>I think making an EcoCreature is really cool. Also, you could make any animals out of your own creations. It doesn't even have to be real! Who knows, maybe there is a pet that looks like you Creature....</p> <p>— iloveBigBang, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>it is good that we have animals they help us with a lot of things</p> <p>— miss12311, Age 12</p>
      <hr> <p>I think its fun Im going to change my humming bird into a hummingbirdunicorn. I love hmmingbirds and unicorns. so if you see a hummingbird combined with a unicorn named kit thats me.</p> <p>— janekit8, Age 8</p>
      <hr> <p>i think all of Eekocreature is really cool, sometimes boring, but good. you need to add a range of fairies, and maybe add something like that you can make your oun person and like get enough points to get a bike, and let your animal come with you. you also need to add a baby unicorn, horses, and all of the other animals in babies. i also think it is cool the way you learn things by looking at facts and information, but i think it would be better if you could buy a bike or some kind of transportation besides a car, and get more points for things. also, maybe you could make more of an animal-type house that you can watch your pet and clean up after it. maybe going somewhere and accually having more of a school time and making friends that go on it. all i really want is not to many cars, no gender-anything, more choices of animals to get, an easier way to get to the hall of fame, and well, i guess not to much more to write here. you may think i am greedy, but really compared to my big brother, i am 1 percent of greedy. you don't have to add all these things, except that's what i think would make it better. well, hee hee, i better go away before i start talking about my favorite animals-unicorns. bye!</p> <p>— hummeg, Age 9</p>
      <hr> <p>It is awesome, because it encourages kids to be earth smart</p> <p>— tyedyepiano, Age 13</p>
      <hr> <p>HI!I love this game I love this game I love my amemil; Anna she a uiunacorn I relley love her.Bye!</p> <p>— courtn3, Age 7</p>
