   <h3>GUIDE TO ACTIVITIES:</h3>
   <p>You hear the sound of a train whistle and music greets you when you arrive at the LOMAX site. You find yourself in a Caboose that looks a lot like the Caboose of the Melody Hounds Express, on the show.</p>
   <p>And just like the show, will be taken on a musical journey, with Lomax, Delta, Amy, Fred, and the fleas, Louise and Clark, and the Gooney Bird, singing songs from all across the country.</p>
   <p>But this Caboose is also an interactive world where you can click on the window to make the Gooney Bird appear, singing the Gooney Bird song, click on a picture of Lomax and play a game with him sliding up and down a fire pole and making silly sounds, or click to various other places inside the Caboose to travel to other areas of the site.</p>
   <h3>Game Area</h3>
   <p>Kids click through to the Game Area where they can find a collection of games and printables.</p>
   <p><b><u><i>SLIDE AND SEEK</i></u></b> features Lomax, Amy, Delta and Fred playing a game with their voices. The goal of the game is to identify the character that's vocally making the same sliding sound that matches the one generated by Lomax when he slides on the fire pole.</p>
   <p>A Voice Over gets things started by encouraging players to click on Lomax on the fire pole to make him slide, and tells them to listen carefully.</p>
   <p>When the sequence ends, the user hears more instructions about listening to the characters on the right, to see which one sings the sliding sound that matches what Lomax has done on the fire pole. The characters to the right then do their pitch sequences one after another - at which point the player is prompted to choose the character who matched Lomax.</p>
   <p>When you click on a character, the user receives feedback based on whether the answer was correct or incorrect. If the user has guessed incorrectly, he/she receives feedback about playing again with another pitch sequence.</p>
   <p>If the user has correctly guessed the pitch sequence that matches Lomax, he/she is then presented with 3 options:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Hear one of the characters make the pitch sequence</li>
    <li>Make the pitch noise themselves, with an option to play the pitch sequence again as a reference</li>
    <li>Play again with a different, progressively more advanced pitch sequence</li>
   </ul>
   <p>MELODY MATCH: The game takes place on a Porch, where Lomax, Delta and a Chicken are the featured characters. The goal of the game is to identify which one of them sings the melody matching the one that is played from a boom box.</p>
   <p>A "Play" button on the boom box - can be pressed repeatedly, allowing the user to play the melody as many times as the user wants before he/she guesses the character who sings the same melody.</p>
   <p>Once the radio's melody has been played at least once, the player can try to identify the character singing the same melody. To hear the melody that each character sings, the players needs only to roll over the character with their cursor.</p>
   <p>Lomax gets things started by encouraging the user to click the "Play" button on the radio to hear the melody that he or one of his friends will sing. Then, the player can roll their cursor over each of the other characters to listen to each of their melodies. Then, the player clicks on the character he thinks has the matching song.</p>
   <p>If the player guesses correctly which characters song matches the radio's, he/she can then:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Hear one of the characters sing the melody</li>
    <li>Sing the melody themselves, with an option to play the melody again</li>
    <li>Play again with a different melody</li>
   </ul>
