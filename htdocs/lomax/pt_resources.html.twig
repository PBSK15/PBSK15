   <p>Alan Lomax, the pioneering "tune tracker" for whom "Lomax, the Melody Hound" was named, was one of the world's great collectors of folklore and folk music from the United States, and also from the Caribbean, Ireland, England, Scotland, Italy, and Spain. He and his equally famous musicologist father, John Lomax, contributed over 10,000 field recordings to the Archive of Folk Song at the Library of Congress, and, more than any other musicologists, are responsible for preserving America's folk music heritage. Indeed, many of the songs featured on Lomax: The Hound of Music were discovered by Alan Lomax in the course of his travels across the American countryside. All of us involved in the production of Lomax are honored to be associated with Alan Lomax's work, and are grateful to Alan's daughter, Anna Lomax Wood, for making this possible.</p>

   <p>NIEHS Kids' Pages. You wouldn't automatically suspect that a Web site run by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences would be a fabulous place to find the lyrics - and MIDI versions of the tunes - for scores of notable children's sing-along songs. But it is, and everything you'll find there - from the "ABC Song" to "Zip-a-dee-do-dah" - is available to users without charge. Check it out by clicking on the link below (but be careful to observe copyright laws!):</p>

   <p>MENC: The National Association for Music Education, formerly called the Music Educators National Conference, is the world's largest arts education organization. (Although the association adopted its new name in 1998, it is still known by its original acronym, MENC.) MENC's mission is "to advance music education by encouraging the study and making of music by all." MENC has more than 142,000 members and supporters, including active and retired music teachers, college students studying to become teachers, high school music honor society members, suppliers of music education products and services, and community supporters of school music programs.</p>
   <p>MENC offers a multitude of resources for music teachers, for parents, and for those who wish to advocate for more robust music and arts education programs in their communities. Here are some links you may find useful:</p>
   <p>First, here's a link to resources of general interest to teachers:</p>
