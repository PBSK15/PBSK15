   <p>Pam Arciero (Louise the Flea, Avocado Jane)</p>
   <p>Pam Arciero was born in Hawaii, and literally stumbled into puppetry after breaking her leg while studying acting at the University of Hawaii. Someone suggested she try something that didn't require much agility. She liked it and eventually went on to earn a master's degree in puppetry from the University of Connecticut, which offers some of the most extensive puppetry course work in the country. She is a principal puppeteer with Sesame Street and Between the Lions, performing numerous characters, most notably Grundgetta Grouch and Leona Lion, respectively. She is the Artistic Director of the Eugene O'Neill Puppetry Conference, and has worked on a multitude of adult and children's programs including Blue's Clues, Blue's Room, Chappell's Show, Allegra's Window, The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, TV Funhouse, Eureeka's Castle, and The Great Space Coaster.</p> <a name="anthony_asbury"></a> <img class="bios" src="imgs/pt/pic_anthony_asbury.jpg" width="131" height="152" alt="Anthony Asbury">

Anthony has had an impressive theatrical career as well, playing three seasons in The Haggadah at New York's Shakespeare Festival, and performing Audrey II in the original off-Broadway production of Little Shop of Horrors.

After Federici's death in April 2008, Giordano has continued playing with the E Street Band.

Giordano also was a member of The David Johansen Group and went on to perform with Buster Poindexter and The Banshees of Blue. As a session musician, Giordano's playing has included Madeleine Peyroux's 1996 album Dreamland and Bucky Pizzarelli's 2000 album Italian Intermezzo; the latter's mix of opera, Italian folk, and swing presaged his inclusion in the similarly genre-mashing Sessions Band Tour with Springsteen.

   <p>Sarah Lee Guthrie + Johnny Irion (vocals, guitar)</p>
   <p>Sarah Lee Guthrie (born in Massachusetts in 1979) and Johnny Irion (born in South Carolina in 1968) were married in 1999, and began performing together as an acoustic duo in the fall of 2000. Their music combined Irion's love of rock and blues with Guthrie's roots in folk and country. The distinguishing feature throughout is the couple's caressing harmonies. Guthrie is the youngest daughter of world-renowned folksinger Arlo Guthrie and the granddaughter of the legendary Woody Guthrie. She was two years old when she made her singing debut as part of a children's chorus on Arlo's 1981 album, Power of Love. She worked as her father's road manager on the 1997 Further Festival tour, and, when she saw other members of the tour group enjoying themselves at late-night hootenannies, she picked up an acoustic guitar and started playing as a way of joining in. Like Sarah Lee, Johnny Irion was born into a family of artists. His uncle is author Thomas Steinbeck (John Steinbeck's son), and his grandmother, Rubilee Knight, is a classical violinist. Johnny was a central figure in the vibrant Carolina indie-rock scene of the early '90s, first as a member of Queen Sarah Saturday and later with Dillon Fence. Irion and Guthrie were introduced by a mutual friend (Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes) while the two were working together in Los Angeles. In 1999 Guthrie and Irion joined guitarist Tao Rodríguez-Seeger, grandson of Pete Seeger, and performed as a trio under the name RIG. Since setting out on the road together in 2001, Guthrie and Irion have averaged 180 shows a year. When not performing on their own, they tour nationally with Arlo Guthrie, recently accompanying him at Carnegie Hall with Pete Seeger. Their initial album collaboration, the critically acclaimed Exploration, was released on the New West label in 2005.</p> <a name="levon_helm"></a> <img class="bios" src="imgs/pt/pic_levon_helm.jpg" width="176" height="180" alt="Levon Helm">
   <p>Levon Helm (drums)</p>
   <p>Levon Helm's celebrated career has spanned almost five decades. The drummer, and sometime lead vocalist, for the legendary rock group The Band, Helm is acclaimed for his work on such all-time classic recordings as "The Weight," "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down," and "Up on Cripple Creek." Levon Helm grew up working on a farm in Arkansas. He began playing guitar at the age of eight, but after seeing the F.S. Walcott Rabbits Foot Minstrels, he decided to switch to drums. Helm developed a keen interest in rock &amp; roll, and eventually moved to Memphis, where, at the age of 17, he was discovered by a fellow Arkansan, rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins, and joined Hawking backing band, the Hawks. After adding Canadians Rich Danko, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel, and Robbie Robertson to their lineup, and parting ways with Hawkins, the group changed their name to the Band, became Bob Dylan's backing combo, and, in 1968, became instantly famous with the release of their album Music from Big Pink, ranked #34 by Rolling Stone magazine on its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Helm's famous Midnight Ramble Sessions at "the Barn," his home and studio in Woodstock, NY, feature a variety of musical guests including Elvis Costello, Emmylou Harris, Dr. John, Allen Toussaint, Donald Fagen of Steely Dan, Jimmy Vivino of "Late Night with Conan O'Brien," Ollabelle (which features, among others, his daughter Amy and Byron Isaacs), Catherine Russell, Gillian Welch, Teresa Williams, and Lomax's music director, Larry Campbell. The recently released Dirt Farmer is Levon's first solo, studio album in twenty-five years. Co-produced by Helm, his daughter Amy, and Larry Campbell, Dirt Farmer was awarded a Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album in February 2008.</p> <a name="byron_isaacs"></a> <img class="bios" src="imgs/pt/pic_byron_isaacs.jpg" width="148" height="165" alt="Byron Isaacs">

Byron's bass playing is featured on most of the songs included in the first season of Lomax: The Hound of Music.</p> <br><br><br> <a name="paul_jacobs"></a> <img class="bios" src="imgs/pt/pic_paul_jacobs.jpg" width="170" height="180" alt="Paul Jacobs">

   <p>A native of New York City, Paul started playing piano at age 6, and entered the Juilliard School of Music at age 7. He played at Carnegie Hall at 9 and on Radio Free Europe at age 11. Temporarily forsaking classical piano for rock keyboards and guitar, Paul made his mark in the New York theater scene, co-writing, and serving as musical director of, National Lampoon's famous theatrical review Lemmings, starring Christopher Guest, Chevy Chase and John Belushi, and writing the music for The National Lampoon Show, featuring Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, Richard Belzer and Harold Ramis. Paul was the musical director for Meat Loaf, composing and producing music that earned gold and platinum records in almost every country in the world. Other artists Paul has written for include Mel Tormé, Roger Daltrey, Faith Hill, india.arie, Brian McKnight, Wynona Judd, Ziggy Marley, and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Paul Jacobs' work in children's television has earned him two Emmy awards. He is currently the musical director of Between The Lions, and he's written, arranged and produced over 100 songs for Sesame Street. Getting back to his classical roots, Paul won the 2000 Van Cliburn Institute Amateur Concerto Competition and performed with the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra. Indeed, it is as a classical pianist - and also as a gospel organist - that Paul contributed to Lomax: The Hound of Music. Paul lives in New York City with his wife (and 4-time Emmy winner), Sarah Durkee, and their two children.</p> <a name="howard_johnson"></a> <img class="bios" src="imgs/pt/pic_howard_johnson.jpg" width="133" height="180" alt="Howard Johnson">
