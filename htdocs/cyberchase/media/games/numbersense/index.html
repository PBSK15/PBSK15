He'll run his Number Machine to create a number... then you'll get three numbers between 1 and 9.  You must click on the numbers in the order in which you want them to go into your macine.  the challenge is to make a number larger than the one on Hacker's machine.  Example: 825 is larger than 397.  Sometimes hacker will try to trick you by giving numbers that can't be bigger than his no matter what the combination.  If he tries that click on the 'can't be bigger' button and you'll still win!  Good luck!" WIDTH="550" HEIGHT="400" BORDER="0"></A>
