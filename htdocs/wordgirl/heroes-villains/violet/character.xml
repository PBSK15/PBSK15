	<description><![CDATA[Violet Heaslip is Becky's best friend in the whole world. They met in Art Appreciation Class (after Becky failed art class 3 times in a row). Where Becky lacks creativitiy, Violet is an artistic genius. Violet spends her time day-dreaming and lost in thought. Violet is kind and caring and perhaps a little absentminded. She has a unique perspective on the world, which might be why Becky gets along with her so well.]]></description>
