By allowing youngsters an opportunity to project their more complex thoughts and feelings on characters outside of themselves, stories provide a safe place to explore doubts and queries and often, as the stories are digested, an avenue to understanding. By illustrating and elaborating upon situations like a visit to the doctor, a first day at daycare, or being alone, our show will help demystify these common occurrences for our young viewers. Children will learn that a visit to the doctor isn't necessarily that scary, a first day at daycare can be pleasant after all, and that, often playing alone can be a lot of fun.</p> <p class="instruct_normal">Each story will briefly illustrate another step in children's cognitive and affective development. As their individuality develops, children grow increasingly curious about the world around them and begin to explore their environment more and more. Thus, young viewers will live and learn vicariously through Caillou's mini-adventures. Our show will tackle a variety of fundamental issues in each entertaining vignette: the beginnings of socialization, being alone, feelings, growing-up, discovering the body, independence and experiencing the outside world, and the dynamics within the family - to name a few.</p> <p class="instruct_normal">Even adults can learn a lot about their own child's behavior by watching Caillou, a four year old who lets viewers know exactly what it's like to be a little kid.</p> <p class="instruct_normal">Each five minute episode spotlights a different issue in a child's emotional, social and physical development between the ages one to four.</p> <p class="instruct_normal">Themes highlighted in Caillou include: the beginnings of social behavior, being alone, complex emotions (sadness, empathy, anger, anxiety, fear, etc.), growing up, the human body, language, gender, the family, the outside world, special occasions, holidays and the seasons. Even though the subject matter may seem complex, these themes have been presented in a straightforward, uncomplicated manner.</p> <p class="instruct_normal">Learning is conveyed through the experience of watching Caillou overcome his problem rather than having the lesson outlined by a grown-up. Caillou helps to demystify events that could be perceived as frightening to a young child. Because Caillou's experiences are typical of a young child, viewers can easily identify with him.</p> <p class="instruct_normal"><img src="images/separator_green.gif" alt="separator" height="50" width="380" border="0"></p> <p class="instruct_normal"><img src="images/title_desc_episode.gif" alt="Episode Descriptions" height="50" width="380" border="0"></p> <p class="grownups_bold_red"><font color="#ed1c24">THEME 41: "I LOVE TO PRETEND!</font>"</p> <p class="grownups_bold_blue"><font color="#0077c0">146-7-T41 Just like Daddy</font></p> <p class="instruct_normal">Daddy has a list of things to do around the house.
