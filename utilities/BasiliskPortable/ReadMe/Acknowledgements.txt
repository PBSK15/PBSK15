This portable distribution would not have been possible without the work involved in the following
third-party libraries and tools:

1. WinPenPack for supplying a base framework to build the portable launcher on.
2. Markus Oberhumer, Laszlo Molnar & John Reiser for their work on UPX.
3. Portableapps.com for their convenient AppCompactor GUI.
4. Igor Pavlov for his excellent 7-zip compression program.
